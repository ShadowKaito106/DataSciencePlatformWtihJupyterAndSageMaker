It supports every step from data preparation and model development to team collaboration, deployment, and monitoring of machine learning models. The system is designed to meet requirements for security, user management, cost optimization, and to provide an effective working experience for data scientists.\nWith this platform, you will gain superior benefits compared to traditional methods:\nIt provides a pre-integrated JupyterLab environment on AWS, which is easily accessible from a browser without local installation. You can safely manage and share project resources among team members. It supports popular programming languages like Python, R, and Julia. It integrates tightly with AWS services such as S3, SageMaker, CloudWatch, and IAM. It automates the process of model training and deployment with SageMaker. It manages data and model versions, making it easy to reproduce and improve results. It monitors model performance and service usage costs. With these advantages, the Data Science Platform with Jupyter and SageMaker will help save time, reduce costs, and increase work efficiency in the field of data science.\n"
