To learn how to create IAM users and roles, and VPCs with public/private subnets, you can refer to the labs:
 - [About Amazon IAM](https://000002.awsstudygroup.com/en/)
 - [Works with Amazon VPC](https://000003.awsstudygroup.com/en/)

To use Systems Manager to manage our Windows instances in particular and our instances in general on AWS, we need to grant permissions to our instances to be able to work with Systems Manager. In this preparation, we will also proceed to create an IAM Role to grant these permissions.
